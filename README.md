# Astronomer CLI

### Vendor
- All dependnecies are managed with dep, with the exception of libcompose. It needs to be manually added with `go get github.com/docker/libcompose`. Issue here: https://github.com/docker/libcompose/issues/503.
- Alternatively, it is also a git submodule, which should get pulled in when cloned.
